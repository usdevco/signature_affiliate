<p class="p5">This Contract (the &ldquo;Contract&rdquo;) is entered into by and between <strong><?php echo $name; ?> </strong> (&ldquo;Client&rdquo;) and Signature Impact Windows &amp; Doors, LLC(&ldquo;Contractor&rdquo;), effective <strong><?php echo date('d/m/Y'); ?></strong>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>This Contract constitutes the full, entire and complete agreement between Client and Contractor, is supported by mutual consideration, and is subject to the terms specified below.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5"><strong>Scope of Work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span></strong>Contractor shall perform the scope of work (the &ldquo;Work&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Scope of Work&rdquo;) delineated in the estimate previously provided to Client (Estimate No. <strong><?php echo $estimate_no; ?> </strong> dated <strong><?php echo date('d/m/Y'); ?> </strong>) (hereinafter, the &ldquo;Estimate&rdquo;), which is specially incorporated herein by reference. Unless specifically stated in the Estimate, the Scope of Work shall be limited to the installation of the windows and/or doors set forth in the Estimate and shall<em> not</em> include any demolition work, stucco work, stucco repair work, drywall repair, reinstallation and/or removal, concrete work, plastering, tiling, or any type of work or labor above and beyond the strict installation of windows and/or doors identified in the Estimate. If demolition work, stucco work, drywall repair, replacement and/or removal, concrete work, plastering, tiling, or any type of work or labor above and beyond the strict installation of windows and/or doors is included in the Estimate, Client understands that said additional work is being provided as a courtesy, free of charge and that Client&rsquo;s objection to the finished product shall not constitute a basis to withhold payment. As such, and under no circumstance, shall this additional work be considered &ldquo;Work&rdquo; or part of Contractor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scope of Work.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5"><strong>Payment</strong>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Subject to the terms of this Contract, the total amount set forth in the Estimate (hereinafter, the &ldquo;Contract Sum&rdquo;) shall be paid to Contractor. Unless Client has signed an SIWD Finance Addendum, the Contract Sum shall be paid as follows: (i) Fifty Percent (50%) of the Contract Sum upon the execution of this Contract; (ii) Thirty Percent (30%) of the Contract Sum upon delivery of any portion of materials (e.g. doors and windows) listed in the Estimate; and (iii) Twenty Percent (20%) of the Contract Sum upon the applicable building department&rsquo;s approval of the final inspection applicable to Contractor&rsquo;s Scope of Work or, in the event a permit is not required, then upon Contractor&rsquo;s notice to Client that the Work has been substantially completed. If final inspection has been approved on account of additional work that is outside Contractor&rsquo;s Scope of Work, the final payment shall be due upon Contractor&rsquo;s notice to Client that the Work has been substantially completed. If Client has signed an SIWD Finance Addendum (the &ldquo;Finance Addendum&rdquo;), Client shall be required to pay the Contract Sum pursuant to the terms of the Finance Addendum. Final payment shall <em>not </em>be withheld on account of, (i) minor defects/damage in the Materials (ii) Client&rsquo;s failure to perform additional work required for the approval of final inspection (if applicable), (iii) pre-existing conditions, objections or complaints about items other than the Work, (iv) defects/damage in the Materials that are the product of the fabrication or shipment of the Materials by the manufacturer, (v) any issue directly attributable to the Client or the product manufacturer or (vi) any issue which is otherwise outside of Contractor&rsquo;s control. In the event Client fails and/or refuses to make payment as required herein, or to execute and serve the necessary documentation required by Client&rsquo;s financing company as required by the Finance Addendum, the discount set forth in the Estimate (if any) shall become null and void and the Contract Sum will be adjusted accordingly. Client understands and agrees that said discount is offered in exchange for Client&rsquo;s prompt payment or, if applicable, compliance with the Finance Addendum and, therefore, is expressly conditioned upon Client&rsquo;s complete performance of the obligations set forth herein. Any payment that is not made in accordance with this Contract shall accrue interest at the highest lawful rate in the State of Florida from the day after the payment was due through the date the payment is made.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5"><strong>Changes to Scope of Work</strong>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The parties may agree to modify the Scope of Work in a written change order that is signed by both parties (hereinafter, a &ldquo;Change Order&rdquo;).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>A Change Order shall detail the scope of the additional work to be performed as well as the consideration to be paid by Client for the performance of same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Unless otherwise stated in the Change Order, the amount of the Change Order shall be paid as follows: (i) Fifty Percent (50%) of the Change Order amount upon execution of the Change Order; (ii) Thirty Percent (30%) upon the commencement of the additional work set forth in the Change Order and (iii) Twenty Percent (20%) upon completion of the work required in the Change Order.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Changes shall not be subject to any Finance Addendum; therefore, payment for any Change Order shall be due as set forth in this paragraph notwithstanding Client&rsquo;s prior execution of a Finance Addendum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Client understands that it may become necessary to alter or otherwise modify the Scope of Work due to: (i) additional requirements imposed by the building department or (ii) existing conditions not readily observable to a layperson.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In the event such additional work is required, Contractor shall provide Client with an estimate for the performance of said additional work and the parties shall work together to agree upon a Change Order. In the event the parties cannot agree upon the terms of a Change Order, however, Contractor shall have the right to terminate this Contract and retain the reasonable value of the labor, services or materials furnished through the date of termination or the Initial Payment, whichever is greater.</li>

<p class="p6">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5"><strong>Minor Size Deviations From Sizes Set Forth in the Estimate</strong>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Client understands and agrees that the windows/door sizes set forth in the Estimate are based on rough measurements and that the size of the windows/doors ordered may deviate slightly from the measurements set forth in the Estimate due to a final measurement taken by Contractor after the Contract is signed, but before the windows/doors are ordered from the manufacturer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>This slight deviation in size shall not be considered a change to the Work requiring a Change Order and shall not serve as a basis for Client to declare Contractor in breach of the Contract, withhold payment from Contractor or fail/refuse to comply with the provisions of the Contract.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5"><strong>Access to the Project Site</strong>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Upon the arrival of the windows and/or doors set forth in the Estimate (hereinafter, the &ldquo;Materials&rdquo;) from the manufacturer or manufacturer&rsquo;s vender (as applicable), Contractor shall notify Client and provide Client with a date for the commencement of the Work (the &ldquo;Commencement Date&rdquo;).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Client shall be present at the project site on the Commencement Date for purposes of inspecting the Materials and shall, from the Commencement Date through Contractor&rsquo;s completion of the Scope of Work, furnish Contractor immediate and continuous access to the project site during normal working hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>For purposes of this Contract, &ldquo;normal working hours&rdquo; shall mean Monday through Friday, from 8:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In the event a scheduled installation or inspection must be rescheduled because access to the Project site cannot be provided, a non-refundable re-scheduling fee of $250.00 will be assessed per day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>This fee shall cover the labor, transportation, storage costs, and extended overhead incurred by Contractor on account of Client&rsquo;s failure to provide access.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Client understands and agrees that this fee is not a penalty, but a liquidated damage to reimburse Contractor for damages that are difficult, if not impossible to quantify. The cumulative sum of any such fee(s) incurred pursuant to this provision shall increase the Contract Sum accordingly and shall be paid as part of Client&rsquo;s final payment to Contractor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, Client&rsquo;s failure to provide access as required herein will render any discount set forth in the Estimate null and void, resulting in an increase to the Contract Sum.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5"><strong>Materials</strong>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Client understands that the Materials are specially fabricated for installation at Client&rsquo;s property and, therefore, cannot be returned to the manufacturer. Client shall inspect the Materials upon their arrival to the project site to confirm they are acceptable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Any damage, issues, complaints, grievances, defects, non-compliance, variations or objection related to the Materials must be served upon the Contractor <span class="s1"><strong>in writing</strong></span> within 48 of the Commencement Date. Client&rsquo;s failure to provide same within 48 hours of the Commencement Date shall constitute and irrevocable acceptance of the Materials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Upon delivery of the Materials to the project site, Client shall assume all risk of loss and/or property damage to the Materials, unless such loss or damage is caused by Contractor during the performance of the Work. Contractor shall not under<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>any circumstance be responsible for any loss arising from or related to superseding or intervening events such as theft, vandalism, natural disasters, fire, or other causes beyond Contractor&rsquo;s control.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Client shall be fully responsible for the safe keeping of the Materials from the date they are delivered to the project site to the date they are installed by Contractor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Client further understands that Contractor is not the manufacturer of the Materials and, therefore, is not responsible for any defects or deficiencies inherent in the Materials, regardless of whether they are covered by manufacturer warranties.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Should Client discover any issues with the Materials that may be covered by a manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty, Client shall contact the manufacturer directly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Contractor shall not have any responsibility and/or obligation to assist Client in any way with the presentation of a manufacturer warranty claim. Contractor&rsquo;s voluntary assistance in the submission of any claim shall not be construed as an acceptance of any obligation to do so. Client understands and agrees that final measurements of the Materials delivered may differ from those reflected in the Estimate.</li>

<li class="li5"><strong>Client Responsibilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span></strong>In addition to obligations imposed elsewhere in this Contract, and unless otherwise indicated in the Estimate, Client shall be solely responsible for the preparation, coordination, inspection, and performance of all work relating to the removal and/or replacement of concrete, drywall, stucco, tiles, window treatments, blinds, alarms, shutters, or any other kind of interior or exterior finish necessary for Contractor to complete the Work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>If Contractor is required to remove any blinds, alarms, or alarm sensors that were not removed by Client prior to Contractor&rsquo;s scheduled date of installation, Client shall pay Contractor an additional fee of $20.00 per blind, alarm or alarm sensor Contractor is required to remove. Contractor shall document the quantity of items removed and issue an invoice to Client for same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The amount set forth in the invoice shall increase the Contract Sum accordingly, and shall be paid as part of Client&rsquo;s final payment to Contractor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Client agrees to hold Contractor harmless of and from any and all losses, damages, charges, fees, fines, penalties, and/or costs incurred as a result of Contractor&rsquo;s removal of blinds, alarms and/or alarm systems.
